"https://pec.ac.in/events/98th-foundation-day","98th Foundation Day | Punjab Engineering College","Quick LinksPunjab Engineering College (Deemed to be University) has completed 98 wonderful years since it’s foundation in 1921. A celebratory event was organized to mark the foundation of the college, which started with a lamp lightning ceremony. Chief guest Director, PEC, Dr. Dheeraj Sanghi, ex-Directors Vijay Gupta and Manoj Datta shared the podium with Dr. Divya Bansal. The Chief Guests also included Dr. Siby John (Deputy Director) and Dr. Sushant Samir (Registrar).The lamp lighting ceremony was followed by the Director’s speech, where he started off by wishing Punjab Engineering College, a very happy 98th Birthday. He highlighted his vision for the University and re-emphasized his plans to promote internships and taking up transferred semesters in various institutions and universities to gain lots of exposure, something which is lacking in a lot of graduates of recent time. He also highlighted that Punjab Engineering College has the ‘top 1%’ of students, and inherently it becomes the responsibility of the University to provide them with apt care, attention and opportunities. His moto, change India by taking one step at a time, was highlighted to seek as much help, and as much experience as one possibly could, as it is only then that you learn.He then introduced Dr. Vijay Gupta, and elucidated that they both had a similar vision of what they wanted PEC to be. Dr. Gupta began on a light and yet an emotional note, stating that he was surprised he needed a microphone, as he had taken many a lecture in the same hall, behind the same podium, to an Auditorium full of students, without ever needing a mic. His golden rule, he stated, was that he believed in making many mistakes, but he’d rather err while experimenting than practicing. He too recognized the fact that providing a good student experience was paramount above all things. He then talked about how India still follows a science-based education system which is out of touch with our time and requirements. His speech was supplemented by Dr. Dutta. He opened his speech with a remarkable idea of ‘Free and Unrestricted Choice for Education’ and emphasized on continuous self-evaluation as a key to success. His main idea was that the University should take examples from other institutions, but never try to copy or clone them, the variance that a University provides over other institution is what attracts people. He also stated his idea about restructuring the M.Tech programs and provide more focus on them. His ideas to promote the entrepreneurship and start-ups in India were vivid and he highlighted the errs in using the ranking system for colleges and how they may be inaccurate and might lose their purpose.A dance performance by the Dramatics Club of PEC, and a video entailing the history of PEC and its highlights helped to raise the energy in the room.The event ended by Dr. Divya Bansal thanking all dignitaries and students present there for helping make this day truly memorable.PEC welcomed Mr. Bikram Singh Garewal, the university’s oldest alum at Homecoming 2020: Global Alumni Meet.

With the same objective in mind, The Voyager Program introduces a new experience for the students of Punjab Engineering College (Deemed To Be University) giving them an opportunity for a holistic personality development.The program involves students visiting various Indian states during the summer break in groups of 3 (up to a maximum of 5 groups) allowing them to explore the country and the various communities and cultures that exist within. It involves students exploring the diverse corners of the country with minimal materialistic requirements, focussing on and diving into the beautifully diverse places, people and living conditions.Purpose: The objective of this program is to expose the students to the widely varying living conditions, cultures, values, traditions, beliefs, climate, and geographical conditions all over the country. It aims to engage students with different aspects of life by divulging them into raw social interaction giving them perspective into communities, people and difference in characteristics. It teaches them the importance of experience rather than materialistic things as they have to travel and stay in minimal living conditions in unfamiliar territories. It introduces them to circumstances where they have to enter into dialogue with people from different walks of life.The biggest take away from the program is gaining a perspective on life and the realisation of what things matter to them in life, their ambitions and an opportunity to break socially constructed aspirations. It is an attempt to instil qualities such as inquisitiveness, curiosity, retrospection, compassion and commitment in the fellows.The program is not a tourist experience; it’s a journey of exploring where the fellows will be discovering the country rather than enjoying a vacation. They will enter unknown territories and unknown adventures. The aim is for them to discover themselves during the process of discovering the country.Guidelines: The program is governed by the following general guidelines:Report: The teams will have to submit a detailed report of their 30-40 day journey, featuring every location, duration, their learning, take away and experience. Formulation of the trip around a theme, describing anecdotes, friends etc. are some things that the recollection of the trip can contain.PEC welcomed Mr. Bikram Singh Garewal, the university’s oldest alum at Homecoming 2020: Global Alumni Meet.

Res. Express 4 015702. The Top Cited Paper Award is for corresponding authors from India, for work published across the entire IOP Publishing portfolio in the past three years (2017 to 2019), using citations recorded in Web of Science. The papers are in the top one per cent of the most-cited articles in each subject category along with the most-cited review article published in the last three years.In this article, Sanjeev Kumar and his co-authors reported the effect of Sr and Mn doping on the electrical and magnetic characteristics of BiFeO3 nanoparticles, synthesized by sol-gel technique. They observed that Sr doping in BiFeO3 showed substantial reduction in the leakage current whilst co-doping with Sr and Mn led to lower reduction in the leakage current through offering better performance over undoped BiFeO3, due to changes brought in the defect physics upon doping. Additionally, Sr and Mn co-doped BiFeO3 samples exhibit enhanced magnetization in comparison to undoped and Sr doped BiFeO3, possibly due to interruptions in the spin cycloid of BiFeO3.PEC welcomed Mr. Bikram Singh Garewal, the university’s oldest alum at Homecoming 2020: Global Alumni Meet.

"https://pec.ac.in/ongoing-projects","Ongoing Projects | Punjab Engineering College","Quick LinksComputational Modeling of Helicopter Rotor Blades made up of Smart Composite Materials - Chirag SachdevaThe project aims at the development of next generation of intelligent helicopter rotor blades. With the use of smart composite materials, these intelligent structures would be able to sense the external environment, flight conditions and monitor the structural health in real time.The current state of tools for analyzing smart structures is primitive while simultaneously being expensive and prohibitively time-consuming. To achieve the real-time state awareness capabilities, a tool based on mathematically rigorous Variational Asymptotic Method (VAM) is developed. VAM splits a three-dimensional elasticity problem into a two-dimensional linear cross-sectional problem and a one-dimensional beam problem. It ensures the asymptotic correctness since the method makes no ad hoc assumptions. This is accomplished by taking advantage of certain small parameters inherent to beam-like structures. Thus, the high-tech rotor blade designs that would be computationally intensive to investigate using 3D Finite Element Analysis can therefore be quickly and effectively analyzed using the newly developed tool.The smart piezoelectric materials can act as both Sensors as well as Actuators. During flight operations, these rotor blades shall develop potential differences across the material layers which could be harvested to analyze the health of the blades and flight conditions of operation. This could reduce the number of inspections on the blade and the human error that might appear in the inspections done visually. Additionally, to mitigate the flutter and stall conditions, the embedded control units could provide with the actuation voltage to bring about the structural morphing based upon real time computational inputs.Personal Emotional Doctor (Bot) - Gaurav AroraDepression is a state of low mood and aversion to activity that affects person's thoughts. A good counselling when you're low, can do wonders; a motivational speech can get you started towards your fightback, a good relationship advice can help in relationship crisis. We do have people around us who motivate us in tough times with their experiences of life, but,they end up being judgemental and emotionally biased, because of which we’re not able to completely share our feelings with humans, and are left fighting sadness alone.A machine can't be emotionally biased and judgemental. We plan on building a bot, that gives personalized counselling to the ""sad"" person. The bot will maintain a repository of motivational, psychological content available on the internet, through religious scriptures, through psychological books and will interact with the sad person using that knowledge to heal him. The ""sad"" person can trust the machine, because it won't tell his problem to anyone else, nor would it get judgemental, as normal human beings do. On a machine, we would have the power to keep only positive information in memory, so that it only gives Unconditional personalized positivity.We plan to build the bot using Natural Language Processing to understand the ""sad"" person's problem, using Semantic-Nets(in Artificial Intelligence) at the backend to reply. The replies will be formed from the knowledge-base that is maintained by the system. The proposed knowledge-base system will be formed by extracting information from motivational lectures, books which give people Relationship advices. We plan to extract information from spiritual content available, to help people emotionally.Social Data Mining To Counter Terrorism - Ketan SudTerrorism is a global issue which is affecting many nations directly or indirectly. Analyzing Terrorist Networks is the emerging field of analytics which have been explored in many subdomains viz. authorship analysis, multilingual text mining, feature extraction of dedicated terrorist groups, generating situational alerts or emergency responding systems etc. Terrorist Network Analysis is one of the applications which can help security intelligence to better understand the structure of social networks of terrorist groups of interest. Social media is a largely untapped source when it comes to effective methods of terrorism and while research on the topic exists, the reliance of major intelligence agencies is on traditional methods of identifying and countering terroristic intents. This project aims to use data sourced from Twitter and gradually other social networking sites and portals to create a predictive model to aid in the identification of perpetrators of terroristic activity that may take place.Designing the Multiband Microstrip Patch Antenna (MSPA) for Rectenna - Sunny KumarThe project aims to make Microstrip Patch Antennas for the purpose of designing Rectenna. This antennas is a combinational placement of three layers followed by Ground plane, Substrate and Patch (copper) on the top. In simple words, A Rectenna is a device which is combination of Antenna and Rectifier Circuit. Rectenna converts Microwave range frequencies into the DC current. Therefore I am designing this device for the purpose of Wireless power Harvesting. Wireless power harvesting is a new technology to harvest power from the ambient radio waves.The ability to harvest RF energy, from ambient or dedicated sources, enables wireless charging of low-power devices and has resulting benefits to product design, usability, and reliability. So we can convert this energy into the electrical power by using the devices like Rectenna. Therefore we can use this energy to provide power our small power required devices. It is true that the energy obtained by this technology is not very high but we can make our sensors and other small equipment automatic working. By using this technology battery-based systems can be trickled charged to eliminate battery replacement or extend the operating life of systems using disposable batteries. Battery-free devices can be designed to operate upon demand or when sufficient charge is accumulated. In both cases, these devices can be free of connectors, cables, and battery access panels, and have freedom of placement and mobility during charging and usage. The Harvested energy can be used to charge or operate a wide range of low-power devices. At close range to a low-power transmitter, this energy can be used to trickle charge a number of devices including GPS or RLTS tracking tags, wearable medical sensors, and consumer electronics such as e-book readers and headsets. Depending on the power requirements and system operation, power can be sent continuously, on a scheduled basis, or on-demand. In large-scale sensors deployments significant labor cost avoidance is possible by eliminating the future maintenance efforts to replace batteries.Biometric Based Locking System - Gaurav ShuklaA number of biometrics have been in use to identify individuals, the standard one being based on fingerprints, other relying over DNA, hand geometry, face, iris, retina, signature, ear-shape, voice etc. However, each of these has some minor setbacks. These are long testing times like in case of DNA (It takes 24-72 hours for identification). Or susceptible to duplication (face, hand prints, signature etc.).However, another biometric based on EEG has come up in the recent years. It is one of the most fraud resistant biometrics. A research study has found a direct relationship between the EEG and the genetic information of a person. Therefore, EEG is a unique parameter over which user identification can be performed. EEG signals are used to record the electrical activity from the brain. These are recorded non-invasively from the scalp using electrodes placed on standard positions throughout it.My objectives are to firstly identify the features in the EEG of a person that are unique as well as robust therefore not varying with time. Then I have to develop my own EEG headset after I have identified the lobes from where the unique features have been extracted. All the above objectives once met can be linked to almost any locking system that can be used in safes, doors, vehicles etc. Completion of this project can solve a number of problems pertaining to security and has a greater scope in the coming years when the reliance on other standard biometrics will decrease and new security tools will be required. Even Elon Musk has shown interest in Brain Computer Interfacing technology by creating Neuralink, a company set upto develop advanced biotechnology enhancements for the human brain. The project I am working on can solve a number of problems pertaining to security and has a greater scope in the coming years when the reliance on other standard biometrics will decrease and new security tools will be required.Lead-free Pyroelectric Material for Energy Harvesting Applications - Nikhil Arora (now Subham Panda)In our project the thrust is for looking advanced materials with ultra-high pyroelectric performance around room temperature and thus the present work is an attempt to explore the Barium Calcium Titatanate (BCT) with various dopants. These materials have permanent dipoles which change their orientation on the application of the heating and cooling of these materials.A number of thermal energy harvesting devices are based on thermoelectric, photovoltaic, and solar thermal where pyroelectric materials have unique advantage as these respond only on thermal fluctuations. One of the energy harvesting applications using these materials could be during dawn and dusk time as photovoltaic devices cannot efficiently work during this period. It is due to fact that solar energy is not sufficient enough for photovoltaic devices during dusk and dawn. Whereas, pyroelectric devices can perform more effectively because of large temporal temperature changes during these time frame. Pyroelectric energy harvesting devices are complementary with other devices in true sense.In this work where various materials, circuit and different methods are being explored. All the findings may suggest an avenue to design pyroelectric devices having superior performance and possible substitution to lead based ceramics. On successful completion of the project, we can make the energy system of the world completely environment-friendly and lead-free. Utilising the wasted heat to harvest energy can put a huge impact on the energy scarcity of the world.Solar Powered Load Carrying Bot - Tarun GoyelThis project aims at developing an eco-friendly solar powered load carrying. This bot is completely different form the other bots already present in the market. Its power consumption is ¼ times the power that other bots carry and is a whole new concept of charging it with solar power. A completely revolutionized innovation that can charge the batteries in just 4 hours via solar panel and once completely charged, it can work continuously work for 8 hours. It can be an aid for modern industries which are dependent on the machines. Incorporating this bot in industries can lead to increasing the overall productivity of the industry by greater extent.The body of the Bot would be made of sheet metal and the tires would have planetary gear arrangement in which single tire can carry a maximum load of 150Kg. There would be total of 6 tires powered from the motors. For carrying the load, lead screw mechanism would be incorporated which has greater strength and easy rotating characteristics.There would also be a digital touch screen LCD Screen which will show all the parameters such as battery capacity remaining, beginning and end location, total load carried etc. This would enable remote operation from both mobile as well as PC connected over a same network.Copyright © 2020 Punjab Engineering College (Deemed to be University), Sector 12, Chandigarh, 160012"

"https://pec.ac.in/nss","NSS | Punjab Engineering College","Quick LinksNational Service Scheme is a student centered programme and it is complementary to education. It is a noble experiment in academic extension. It inculcates the spirit of voluntary work among students and teachers through sustained community interaction. It brings our academic institutions closer to the society. It is a link between the campus and community, the college and village, knowledge and action. The overall aim of NSS is the Personality Development of students through community service. It gives an extension dimension to Higher Education system and orients the student youth to community service.The youth in all ages has been in the vanguard of progress and social change, thirst for freedom, impatience for quicker pace of progress and a passion for innovation, coupled with idealism and creative fervour, saw the youth in the forefront of the freedom struggle in our own land. Ever since independence there has been growing awareness of the desirability of involving students in National Service. The first Education Commission (1950) recommended the introduction of national service by students on a voluntary basis, but NSS was officially included in the curriculum for University students, along with National Sports Organization (NSO) and National Cadet Corps (NCC), after the Conference of State Education Ministers in April 1967.National Service Scheme, popularly known as NSS, was formally launched on 24th September, 1969, the birth centenary of the Father of the Nation. 24th September is celebrated every year as NSS Day nationwide.The scheme now extends to all the states and universities in the country. Students, teachers, parents, guardians, persons in authority in government, universities and colleges and the people in general now realize the need and significance of NSS. NSS is, thus a concrete attempt in making education relevant to the needs of the society.The motto of NSS is 'NOT ME BUT YOU'. This reflects the essence of democratic living and upholds the need for selfless service and appreciation of the other person’s point of view and also to show consideration for fellow human beings.Copyright © 2020 Punjab Engineering College (Deemed to be University), Sector 12, Chandigarh, 160012"
"https://pec.ac.in/ncc","NCC | Punjab Engineering College","Quick LinksNational Cadet Corps in India was conceptualized and raised before independence, mainly with an aim to groom the youth, boys and girls both, nurture them and channelize their energy towards nation building by making them responsible citizens. The NCC is a voluntary organization which is administered through the Ministry of Defence. The Defence Secretary is overall in charge, who is responsible to the Govt of India for efficient functioning of the NCC and other matters. After independence, the present day NCC came into existence on 16 Apr 1948, through XXXI Act of Parliament. NCC was formally inaugurated on 15 Jul 1948. The Girls Division of the NCC was raised in Jul 1949. On 01 Apr 1950, Air Wing was raised, with one Air Squadron each at Bombay and Kolkata. The Naval Wing of the NCC was raised in Jul 1952, thus completing the true representation of all services in the Corps. National Cadet Corps is a Tri-Services Organization, comprising the Army, Navy and Air Force. NCC in India is a voluntary organization which recruits cadets from high Schools, Colleges and Universities all over India. The Cadets are given basic military training in small arms and parades. The officers and cadets have no liability for active military service once they complete their course but are given preference over normal candidates during selections based on the achievements in the corps. The NCC Day is observed on the fourth Sunday of November.Copyright © 2020 Punjab Engineering College (Deemed to be University), Sector 12, Chandigarh, 160012"

"https://pec.ac.in/donations/content/establishing-scholarships-financially-underprivileged-students","Establishing Named Scholarships for Financially Underprivileged Students | Punjab Engineering College (Deemed to be University), Chandigarh","Punjab Engineering College Chandigarh is looking to establish several scholarships for its students through philanthropic contributions. Currently, an undergraduate student spends roughly Rs. 2.5 lakhs a year on tuition, lodging and boarding. It is desirable that a scholarship provides some reasonable financial support compared to the total expenditure of the student. Hence, it has been decided that the minimum amount of scholarship that can be established at PEC will be Rs. 50,000 per annum. Donors may wish to establish scholarships with larger amounts.In order to provide a scholarship of Rs. 50,000 per annum, it is proposed to establish an endowment of Rs. 10 lakhs. The interest earned on this endowment will be used to disburse the scholarship amount. The excess interest (more than 5 percent) will be ploughed back to the endowment so that its amount also increases, and in future, the scholarship amount can be increased. It may be noted that despite some interest amount being added to the endowment, the real value of endowment will reduce over a period of time due to inflation, and a top up may be needed after some time.A donor can specify the criteria for selection of students. These criteria could include merit (minimum CGPA, for example), means (maximum income limit, for example), or both. A donor could also specify the department in which the scholarship is to be established, the year of the student (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th), or gender.The scholarship can be named as per the wishes of the donor.Currently, the Institute is interested in supporting the following category of students:Students from low income families:Please note that the Institute may decide on additional criteria on eligibility for scholarships. For example, it is expected that students getting means based scholarship will pass all courses, while students getting merit based scholarships will have a CGPA of at least 8.5. It is also required that the student has not been barred as part of disciplinary action.To encourage establishment of endowment based scholarships for those categories of students whom the Institute wants to support, it has been decided that the scholarship amount will be matched by the Institute. So, if a donor gives an endowment of Rs. 10 lakhs for a scholarship for a student from low income family with income less than Rs. 5 lakhs per annum, the amount of scholarship to the student will be Rs. 1 lakh per annum (Rs. 50,000 from the interest of the endowment, and Rs. 50,000 from the Institute funds).Benefit to the Donor:Download PDFMake Donation"

Depth of anaesthesia (DOA) monitors has been introduced to provide the information about the state of patient. It has not been possible to develop a system capable of quantifying the analgesia. So, to minimize the effect of pain due to skin incision on a patient, it is required to find some correlation between pain stimuli due to skin incision and EEG signal.Read moreEnhance Walking Stability of Patients with Foot Drop Using Ankle Foot Orthosis Fabricated by Additive ManufacturingPassive dynamic ankle-foot orthoses (AFO’s) are used to improve gait performance in those with various neuromuscular disorders.

Men and women of all ages are self-conscious about their dentures, bridges or missing tooth. Some have difficulty speaking because their dentures slip or click. Moreover, they feel aged before time due to tooth loss. A number of options exist for the replacement of missing teeth. The most recent of these is dental implants. Dental implants offer an excellent alternative to the limitations of conventional dentures, bridges and missing teeth. Patient suffering from tooth loss having limited bone to support the implant and needs accurate placement due to adjacent anatomical structures.Dental drill guides are the solution to these problems. There have been many advances in the field of implant dentistry that have improved the success and predictability of implant placement. One such advancement is the use of dental drill guides. These guides have allowed surgeons to place implants in areas where there is limited bone, and in locations where adjacent anatomical structures require accurate placement. This has improved patient care by allowing implant placement in areas that may have otherwise required grafting and additional surgeries. The major problem reported in the use of dental drill guides is rise in bone temperature which further results in series of problems.Read moreMental Health Assessment using Physiological SignalsOver the past few years the burden of work and expectations on the students has increased significantly.

The extent to which the prosthesis reproduces normal facial morphology depends on the clinical judgment and skill of the individual fabricating the prosthesis. Recently, as a result of advances in technology, various computer-aided design and additive manufacturing techniques such as Fused Deposition Modelling have been successfully introduced for the automated fabrication of maxillofacial prostheses. These systems are able to provide more consistently accurate reproduction of facial morphology . Potential problems associated with conventional impressions include patient discomfort and distortion of the facial soft tissues. Also, the conventional technique available requires the technician to spend time carving and adapting the prosthesis to a cast of the deficient side of the face. Hence, these techniques rely upon the skill and individual ability of the technician. Due to the digitized imaging technology, it has become possible to obtain noncontact three-dimensional facial measurements and three-dimensional anatomic model which is more accurate and low in price.Read moreEffects of Micro -breaks in Prolonged SittersSitting down at work could be contributing to weight gain and increase our risk of developing serious diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cancer . Regular short bursts of movement reduces these risks and may also boost performance. Long periods of time spent sitting is bad for our health and bad for concentration, because we often underestimate the number of hours we spend sitting in work everyday. Studies done internationally indicate that prolonged sitting leads to multiple diseases such as MSD, Type II Diabetes, CVD. In India the Banking & IT sector having large number of jobs related to prolonged sitting and has a very high incidence of the referred diseases, and sedentary habits related to work environment has not been studied. No attempt has been made to understand this by policy makers or the industry . Prolonged sitting culture is becoming prevalent in modern days which is an example of unhealthy workplace, we must change our sedentary lifestyle. As more occupations in the IT & Banking sector call for long periods of sitting down, it is crucial to encourage people to look for opportunities to get up and move at work. In addition to reducing our risk of developing serious diseases, the performance benefits are considerable:- reducing our risk of developing serious diseases, the performance benefits are considerable:-better concentration, more energy, less fatigue. No one would dispute the benefits of exercising regularly, however this typically happens outside the workplace, where we spend ever more time sitting. Research shows that regular exercise does not offset completely the negative health effects of prolonged sitting.Read moreCopyright © 2020 Punjab Engineering College (Deemed to be University), Sector 12, Chandigarh, 160012"

The session focussed on developing the ability to view and analyze differently whilst stimulating tools to validate the idea and develop a Business Model Canvas (BMC) for their innovations, said Dr Anju Singla, President, IIC, PEC.The session was inaugurated by Dr. Dheeraj Sanghi, Director PEC. A team from MIC led by Mr. Dipan Sahu, Executive Consultant, MIC, Experts from EDII, Ahmedabad (Knowledge Partner), and the team of EIC & IIC (Dr. Anju Singla, Mr. Mayank Gupta, Dr. Rakesh Kumar), PEC were also present. .“We need to look at Entrepreneurship in a holistic way. A lot of people are afraid to step towards start-ups thinking that they cannot build the next Google. Creating jobs for even two people or opening a retail shop is also an entrepreneurship”, said Dr. Sanghi.“Today’s Regional Mentoring Session at PEC is the first out of the 14 sessions to be conducted across India. A PoC contest was floated in June 2019 to all IICs. Around 1700 PoCs were received from all over India, out of which 110 students from the North-Western Region of the country participated in the contest. The selected students will get an opportunity to be part of National Start-up Boot Camp to be held at AICTE, New Delhi during the month of August. The best ones will get an opportunity to become a part of Indian Start-up Delegation exposure visit to South Korea and Canada ecosystems”, said Mr. Dipan Sahu. He further informed that the registrations are open for ARIIA 2020 and the institutes interested in establishing an Institution’s Innovation Council in their campus can also register with the MHRD’s Innovation Cell.Towards the end of the session students also pitched their ideas to team of experts and gained significant insights about their PoCs.PEC welcomed Mr. Bikram Singh Garewal, the university’s oldest alum at Homecoming 2020: Global Alumni Meet.

"https://pec.ac.in/rules-guidelines-forms/engagement-classes","Engagement of Classes and Attendance | Punjab Engineering College","Quick LinksFor maintaining the highest academic standards at PEC, the following should be adhered to by all concerned involved in engaging classes and recording the attendance: A. Engagement of Classes:All classes are to be held as per announced time-table. The time table of an individual faculty member must be displayed outside his/her room and also on the website (standard format available with Webmaster for uploading). No scheduled class should be left unengaged. If a class has to be rescheduled due to certain reasons, it must be done with prior intimation to the HOD and the students, about the alternate class. Even in emergencies (medical or otherwise), it is the responsibility of a faculty member to inform the HOD or his office by telephone/messenger of the re-scheduling of a class. This information must also reach the students. Normally a class should commence within 5 minutes of the starting time and should finish not earlier than 5 minutes before end time. Only in rare cases, say once or twice a semester, may a class be disengaged more than 5 minutes before the end-time. Tutorials and practical classes must also be engaged as scheduled. The students must be kept busy during the entire scheduled duration of the class. Classes are to be engaged for the entire semester. There is no provision for completing a course in lesser number of classes than those scheduled as per academic calendar.B. Attendance:The Attendance Register must be maintained properly. The attendance should be recorded in terms of progressive number of classes attended, by a student. Absence in a particular class should be marked as ‘X’ (see the instructions printed in the register in this regard; other instructions given in the register may be treated as amended according to this document). The attendance status of all students must be announced and displayed outside the office of the course instructor at least thrice every semester – before first mid-term exam, before 2nd mid term exam and before the end-term exam. The Attendance Register must be put up to the HOD of the instructor’s department on the first day of every mid-term examination as well as end-term examination for checking/ certification. Thereafter the register is to be kept in safe custody by the Course Instructor.C. Monitoring:1. The HODs are to undertake regular monitoring of engagement of classes, taking the help of faculty, if required. 2. In case a class is found unengaged without intimation with regards to its rescheduling, (i) it must be taken on record, without exception, by the HOD(ii) the concerned course-instructor must be asked to explain the reasons in writing;(iii) HODs are to issue suitable response/advice/admonition etc. as deemed appropriate, in all cases in writing, and report the same to the Director, within a week.3. The Attendance Registers of all the faculty members of the Department must be checked at least twice during every semester – during the days of 1st mid-term & 2nd mid-term exams and once at the end of the semester. The Register is to be returned to the Course Instructor for safe custody.4. An Institute-level mechanism of monitoring, coordinated by a Committee headed by a nominee of the Director, will supplement the Departmental process.Heads of the Departments should bring this to the notice of all concerned in their Departments (by circulation).Copyright © 2020 Punjab Engineering College (Deemed to be University), Sector 12, Chandigarh, 160012"

The Session was attended by 50 students. Mr. Bibhu highlighted the Heptagon of exponential growth. There are seven major elements to growth at a constant proportion, an exponential growth. One of the major one beings, to have a guide or a guru in your life. There needs to be a pallbearer, who shows the results and the consequences. It is said, Experience speaks much louder than effort does. The second one is to Acquire wisdom faster than it's too late. For growth, all the loopholes and advantages have to be known before it's all gone in a snap. Things change faster in the business world than anywhere else. Years of hard work and success can be lost even due to a lack of wisdom. It's important to Respect everything when you have it. Maybe the next second it all goes away, and a person is left with nothing else but regret. Growth happens when there is a desire to achieve more at every step. Thus, it's natural to Stay hungry, stay foolish. Anything and Everything can be done if we Activate our subconscious mind and awaken the giant within. It's all about what we think and how we want to create it. Our mind is the most powerful tool that can be used to achieve the greatest things in life. Let effort be the luckiest thing in your life. Most people believe their success is dependent on the destiny factor. Truth is your hard work is the greatest luck you have. We can write our Future and defy destiny if we decide to achieve. All these learnings play a key role in exponential growth. Just don't try hard and go with what's happening while keeping all these in mind and you shall experience growth and results in no time.

The objective was to bridge the gaps between academics and Industry by providing a platform for various experts to share their domain knowledge for the accelerated growth of students especially in the emerging domains like Machine Learning, Security, IoT, Data Science, Data Analytics, Cloud Computing, Algorithms, Software Development and other interdisciplinary research areas.TOPIC OF SESSION 1: CYBER SECURITY TECHNOLOGIESDATE: 5 March 2019, TIME: 11:30-1 PMMr. Ali Ghorbani from Canadian Institute of Cybersecurity, University of New Brunswick started the session discussing the concept of cybersecurity which is the set of techniques used to protect the integrity of networks, programs and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access. He also emphasized on cyber bullying, cyber attacks by countries and spear phishing which has led to more focus on cybersecurity. He also outlined the various courses offered at his university which focus on research areas like network security, system security, security visualization, privacy enhancing technologies, IOT big data security and privacy and critical infrastructure protection. One of the prominent areas of research is fake news detection as it highly affects the psychology of masses. Fake news or junk news or pseudo-news is a type of yellow journalism or propaganda that consists of deliberate disinformation or hoaxes spread via traditional print and broadcast news media or online social media. It consists of mainly four main parts: creator, news content, target victims and social content. He outlined the components of fake news ecosystem namely intervention, fact checking, fake news detection, potential fake news prediction and suspiciousness analysis, psychological prevention awareness and discrimination capability. The speaker concluded the expert talk by elaborating upon various challenges and research scope in the domain of cybersecurity. Finally the lecture ended up with questionnaire session and discussion of students and speaker.TOPIC OF SESSION 2: DATA ANALYTICS AND CLOUD COMPUTINGDATE: 5 March 2019, TIME: 2-4 PMMs. Ekta Goel from Infosys Limited started the session discussing the meaning and concept of big data along with its three main characteristics i.e. variety, velocity and volume. Variety refers to different types of data, velocity refers to high speed of data processing and volume refers to amount of data. Since data is exponentially increasing every second, therefore need for analysis of data is imperative. The process of analysing data to find meaningful patterns is known as data analytics. She also explained data analytics using splunk which is a comprehensive tool to collect discrete machine data and provide an efficient way to analyse, troubleshoot and investigate various incidents. She also explained one of the main use case of splunk: point of sale analytics. In her expert talk she also provided an overview of the concept and need for cloud computing and how it can help in big data analytics. She elaborated upon various cloud services like Saas, Paas, Iaas. Use of SaaS applications tends to reduce the cost of software ownership by removing the need for technical staff to manage install, manage, and upgrade software, as well as reduce the cost of licensing software. PaaS is built on top of virtualization technology. Businesses can requisition resources as they need them, scaling as demand grows, rather than investing in hardware with redundant resources. IaaS is the most flexible cloud computing model and allows for automated deployment of servers, processing power, storage, and networking. The speaker also gave a demo using Amazon Web Services which is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms to individuals, companies and governments, on a paid subscription basis.

He motivated the students that a lot can be done by a software engineer for the national security. For example- Implementing SewageTreatment at Solapur, a smart city project for helping the nation. This can be done by placing IoT sensor devices to detect quality and quantity and avoiding the attacks like the case in which the excess chlorine was added in the water. Another project could be Writing software for movement of trucks of military. The major concern regarding this is THE STORAGE OF DATA, as the major softwares, communicators, data storage locations are owned by USA. There is no way of controlling how data gets out of cyber space. We cannot give smart phones to “jawans” as there will be a risk of privacy breach. The practical example of this is Kargil war in which GPS was turned off by USA and we lost around 5,000 soldiers. Similar case can be observed in JalliKattu Riots. All of these incidents conclude that we are secure physically but not from cyber space point of view. They can manipulate the data as they required, commonly known as Information Warfare.The term means that mindset of the people can be changed based on the collected data. The real life example of this is Cambridge Analytica, personalised adds to manipulate the perception of people. Few terms were introduced like CyberCommons, CyberColony, CyberColonial Power. Some of the achievements done by his company for nation include Seculink-Domain controller with patch management is provided to the defence of India to control whole network so that data remains within you, Seculink UTMS, AvrakOS- in this open source code of some OS is picked and that part is cleaned where the data goes out, SecuMobile-specially designed for Indian defence with 100% owning of the software. He motivated the students to show their keen interests in this field for the nation’s security by joining the various startups, and the guest also showed the interest in hiring the young and talented engineers in this area.TOPIC OF SESSION 4: NEW SPACE ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND RISING OPPORTUNITIES IN THE SPACE SECTORDATE: 6 March 2019, TIME: 2-4 PMThe lecture was given by Mr. Ankit Bhateja, Founder and director of Xovian Research and Technologies Pvt.

"https://pec.ac.in/events/roundtable-workshop-draft-personal-data-protection-bill","Roundtable Workshop on Draft Personal Data Protection Bill | Punjab Engineering College","Quick LinksBackgroundPrivacy and Protection is a subject that has seen massive developments in the last few years. Undoubtedly, with the advent of big data and blurring jurisdictions and processes, there have been many questions about data and its rationale in national security, rights of citizens etc.Cyber Security Research Centre (CSRC) at Punjab Engineering College (Deemed to be University); Chandigarh had organised the first workshop to carry out a study of the Justice Srikrishna Committee Paper(first draft) on Data Protection from a National Security Perspective on Jan 28, 2018. The finings of the study were shared in the form of report carrying recommendations to Meity which were duly considered.Along the same lines, there have been multiple citizen movements centric to the idea of data privacy and rights of data principals/users. Debates about surveillance, data localisation, defining key terms and the concurrence with the GDPR have been ongoing and have slowly occupied centre stage.As a result of these discussions with various experts and recent developments in the domain, it was felt that a comprehensive list of comments and recommendations must be prepared after brainstorming exercises with multiple stakeholders. Data, in the long run is most likely going to drive nations, policies and international relations as well. To further this objective of understanding the draft bill and working on the issues that it has presented, it has become an urgent need to present the right problems and alternate solutions to the lawmakers.The deadline for the submission has been extended to September 30, 2018,CSRC, PEC and Cyber Peace Foundation have come together to organise another two days long workshop and discussions on Sept 24 – 25, 2018 on the draft law.Major Highlights and Discussions of the Day:Gen. D.S. HoodaHe bought out the point that there can be no privacy without security. There needs to be different laws/provisions to cover CII (Critical Info Infrastructure) where the Government and various sensitive organizations and their manpower are covered with special provisions. Indigenous Technology will be a key component in this particular data protection framework. The proposed Data Protection Authority of India should mandatorily have members who are from military background with specialization in Information Warfare.DR. DIVYA BANSAL, PROFESSOR AND HEAD, CSRCThe Consent based framework has two be two fold. A draft personal data protection bill today proposed ""explicit consent"" for processing 'sensitive personal information. 'Sensitive personal data' comprises of data including passwords, financial data, genetic data, health data, sexual orientation, caste or tribe or religious or political belief.Should politicians also be made to notify or seek choices and declare as to how they plan to track our likes and dislikes and profile individuals for political purposes and influence minds by targeting individuals using personalised advertisements? One may also want to look into whether tailored political advertising would affect National Sovereignty.Given that our Nation is going leaps and bounds progressively towards the Technology Advancements like AI, Big Data, IoT, and Cloud. Globally, we are moving on to become a Data Driven Decision Making. Individuals are profiled based upon the data so collected and automated decision making takes place on the basis of data so collected and integrated and correlated. In the UK, automated decision making based upon data being sponsored collected from different sources including social media has evolved into credit scores and are being used to determine whether people can get a credit card or loan. It may become a nightmare if the “social credit” system as developed by Chinese, government determining the “trustworthiness” of the country’s 1.4 billion citizens. This Social credit might prevent people from buying airline and train tickets and many other activities (launched in 2014 and is supposed to be nationwide by 2020)While we are looking at explicit consent based framework in Draft Data Protection Fill, shouldn’t Individuals also have the right of not to be a part of results of automated decision making and hence have right to opt out?DR. SD PRADHAN, FORMER Dy. NSA & JIC CHAIRMAN, MEMBER, ADVISORY BOARD, CSRCIn the Round Table Workshop various aspects related to the draft Personal Data were discussed. The participants stressed that all the data aggregated and processed through advanced algorithm becomes national strategic asset and therefore it must be ensured that data is not misused for subversion of national sovereignty. The naming of Data Processing Authority was also discussed and there was a census that there should be a specialized cadre for this task. The members also pointed out that data when not needed should be deleted. They also emphasized that all personal data must be stored in servers in India. Mr. Vineet, President, Cyber peace Foundation TeamMR. RAJ PAGARIYA, MR. ABHAY SINGH & MR. NITISH CHANDAN, Cyber Peace Foundation TeamMS. GEETA GULATI, Lawyer, Punjab & Haryana High CourtOther Important Questions which were raisedThe discussions and brainstorming done during the workshop was found to be very insightful. The illustrious experts represented national security experts like Gen. D.S. Hoada, Dr. S.D. Pradhan, renowned lawyers expert in the subject, academicians and researchers and representation from the industry. The workshop will conclude tomorrow in which some very important issues on Data Localization and cross border flow of data will also be discussed and the discussions and recommendations will be compiled to be sent to the Government of India. The exercise has been found to be very useful as domain experts from various fields participated in making of the very important Data Protection law of India which a historical move in itself.PEC welcomed Mr. Bikram Singh Garewal, the university’s oldest alum at Homecoming 2020: Global Alumni Meet.

"https://pec.ac.in/events/industry-academic-expert-lecture-week-cyber-security-research-centre","Industry Academic Expert Lecture Week by Cyber Security Research Centre | Punjab Engineering College","Quick LinksDAY 1: 04/9/2018Session 1: Scenario based problems for Security Plan, Security Analysis and Security DesignSpeaker: Cmdr. L.R. ParkashCommander L.R. Parkash, director CDAC – Chennai, began the session with a brief introduction of various activities being conducted at CDAC-Chennai which includes developing open source software; security related products and conducting various training programmes. The lecture started with the definition of the word ‘security’ and he quoted that security is fully dependent on context. He further emphasized on Enterprise View which can be referred as combination of Business Continuity Management, Information Security and IT Disaster Recovery. Security Plan can be mentioned as a formal plan of action to secure a computer or information system. He gave the example of a College Network System to briefly explain about the implementation of security planning. The speaker also focussed on Risk Assessment and Analysis which included Threat, Asset and Vulnerability and supplemented it with the example of JAVA Exploit. Different phases of Security System Development Life Cycle were discussed. The session summed up listing various international security standards like MOF, COBIT, SABSA, NIST, ISO/IEC-27000 for generating security plans and highlighting the importance of Security Education, Training and Awareness Programme.Session 2: Security Review through Security AuditSpeaker: Cmdr. L.R. ParkashCmdr. L.R. Parkash started the session by highlighting how to write an information security plan for a particular system. Security plan document mainly specifies purpose and scope, mission and vision, organizational structure, output and information assets etc. An information asset need not be limited to IT systems. Information assets summary plays crucial role to find out scope of system. Workflows and other processes that are important to the administration of the organization need to be secured. While writing information security plan, one must be specific but being too specific may lead to backdoors or vulnerabilities into the system. So a balance must be attained. He interacted with the audience and discussed what personal data is and why critical sensitive data should be kept private. All students were grouped to make a sample information security plan document for PEC. Risk assessment, listing all acceptable risks, privacy controls and security initiatives are other factors which need to be considered while planning information security plan. Session ended up with list of 20 CSC (Critical Security Controls) which are decisive to any information security plan. CSC is kept in appendix part of plan document.DAY 2: 05/9/2018Session 1: CryptographySpeaker: Cmdr. L. R. ParkashCommander L. R. Parkash began the session on cryptography protocols by interacting with the students and sharing various real-life examples of encryption and decryption. He talked about Symmetric vs. Asymmetric key encryption and their various issues. There is an exponential increase in the number of keys to be shared in case symmetric key encryption. It also becomes matter of concern how to share the key securely. On the other hand, Asymmetric key encryption needs to address physical key distribution and key revocation issues. Although Asymmetric key encryption provides confidentiality, authentication, integrity and non-repudiation, however in practice it is not scalable and it is must costlier. So, in practice, hybrid encryption approach utilising symmetric as well as asymmetric encryption is used. He interacted with students to generate a keypair and send an encrypted message to each other. Speaker also discusses about the Public Key Infrastructure and how the certificates are signed and shared. A certificate authority issues a certificate, provides the public key, and checks the key revocation. At the end, the students were grouped and asked to set up a Certificate Authority Server, generate certificates and GPG system. This added a dimension of practical implementation to his session and intrigued everyone in attendance.Session 2: Blockchain TechnologySpeaker: Mr. Arshdeep BaghaMr. Arshdeep Bagha, Director, Cloudemy Technology Labs LLP, Chandigarh started the session discussing the four industrial revolutions, the fourth one being the Cyber Physical Systems. He explained the concept of blockchain technology along with its evolution. Further he discussed about web 1.0, web 2.0 and web 3.0 in which blockchain came under the ambit of web 3.0. The speaker further explained the basic concepts related to blockchains like its definition, structure, Merkel tree etc. He explained the difference between blockchain and Bitcoin and talked about Santoshi Nakamoto and his paper “Bitcoin: A Peer to Peer electronic cash system”. Some of the characteristics of blockchain were discussed e.g. immutable, secure and transparent, no central authority, privacy, scalable and many more. He explained various types of smart contracts like crowd funding contracts, escrow smart contracts, voting smart contract etc. Further, he elaborated upon the Blockchain stack and some of the differences between web app and decentralised app. He also outlined some of the applications of blockchain like Banks, insurance, solar charging stations, shipment tracking and many more. A demonstration of a solar charge app was given. He discussed the double spending problem which refers to the spending of same money more than once and wrapped up the session with some of the challenges and future prospects in blockchain technology.Session 3: Cryptography Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Digital SignaturesSpeaker: Cmdr. L.R. ParkashCmdr. L.R Parkash began by talking about Cryptography Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Digital Signatures. The speaker explained how different types of websites are certified by Certifying Authorities (CAs). Financial websites require a lot more checks as compared to other websites therefore extended validations are applied by them to get certificates from CA. He also spoke about secure communication using symmetric and asymmetric encryption techniques and explicated the concept of domain by defining it as a boundary of control. A brief explanation of the root CA was given and where this root CA is present. Taking an example of DigiCert, he mentioned that the root CA also has many intermediate CAs which share its workload. There are different types of certificates such as personal certificates, commercial certificates, other people certificates etc. The contents of a certificate were discussed in detail. CDAC has developed a digital signing system known as e-Hastakshar- CDAC’s eSign service that facilitates instant signing of documents online by citizens in a legally acceptable form. He ended the talk with the discussion of eSign architecture and motivated the students to work in the area of digital signatures and other relevant spheres of technological advancement needed in our modern society.Session 4: Hands-on Workshop on Competitive ProgrammingSpeaker: Mr. Sandeep Jain, Mr. Ayushman BansalThe founders of the extremely popular learning database- Geeks for Geeks- started the session with the story of their website’s inception and how their aim was to motivate students to prepare for placement interviews. They mentioned their humble beginnings and how they used to contact students from IITs to know about interview questions and patterns and then they prepared for the same questions in order to crack placement interview. While learning through this process, the team came up with idea of building their own group to share interview experience and questions, hence came up with a big platform for the same. Data Structures and Design of Algorithms are two key subjects to be mastered for a computer science student, according to the speakers. These core subjects play a vital role in every job profile and must be mastered. They spoke about fair pay and disclosed that they give remuneration to students for their contribution to geeks for geeks. Various key categories of geeks for geeks website were also discussed to help students to start their preparation. Internship programs are also offered by geeks for geeks to students to excel their skillset. The talk ended up with an interactive questions and answer session with the enthusiastic students.DAY 3: 06/9/2018Session 1: Key-length ManagementSpeaker: Cmdr. L. R. ParkashCommander L. R. Parkash began the session by discussing symmetric and asymmetric key length management. Brute force attack on the key involves large computation and a parallel processing is often involved for effective brute force. He gave an example of Chinese Lottery to understand the concept of parallel processing involved for brute-force. Key length management has practical and mandatory safeguards which need to be followed. The concept behind the Dictionary attack, Length Extension attack and Rainbow Table attack was discussed in detail. A rainbow table is a precomputed table for reversing cryptographic hash functions, usually for cracking password hashes. Tables are usually used in recovering a password (or credit card numbers, etc.) up to a certain length consisting of a limited set of characters. However, a Rainbow Table does not work for Linux passwords. Salting is a means of preventing a Rainbow Table attack. A commonly used cryptosystem for GSM communications is the A5 ciphering algorithm. He advised to have an up to date knowledge on the legal advisor regarding the length of the keys. A case study on recently held cyber-attack called ‘ATM Jackpotting Attack’ on Pune based Cosmos Bank was discussed. The ATM jackpotting technique is basically an exploitation of both physical and software vulnerabilities in banking kiosks or dispensing machines such as ATMs. At the end of the session, speaker motivated the students to read these real-life case studies, analyse various security lapses and relate them with theoretical knowledge.Session 2: Virtual Private NetworksSpeaker: Cmdr. L. R. ParkashCommander L. R. Parkash introduced the concept of port addresses and NAT. NAT maps private IP address to public IP address. The main use of NAT is to limit the number of public IP addresses an organization or company must use, for both economy and security purposes. Port addresses are used to send packets to particular application on a system. Some services or processes have conventionally assigned permanent port numbers. These are known as well-known port numbers. In other cases, a port number is assigned temporarily (for the duration of the request and its completion) from a range of assigned port numbers. Various security features and attacks in this model are elaborated with suitable examples. For example, there may be DoS or DDoS attack on the web server by sending multiple bogus requests to web server to occupy all ports on server. Natting makes provisions such that no outside packet can reach to private network. Net neutrality concept and implications were discussed with students. ISP may peep into personalized traffic to route traffic differently to different users. Further, the speaker talked about Virtual Private Networks. VPN technology was developed as a way to allow remote users and branch offices to securely access corporate applications and other resources. To ensure safety, data travels through secure tunnels and VPN users must use authentication methods -- including passwords, tokens and other unique identification methods -- to gain access to the VPN. Session ended with Cmdr. Parkash motivating the students to thoroughly study basic and advanced communication infrastructure over the internet and create solutions to our day-to-day problems.DAY 4: 07/9/2018Session 1: Applied Cryptographic ApplicationsSpeaker: Cmdr. L. R. ParkashCmdr. L. R. Parkash started the session discussing about Virtual Private Network (VPN) Tunneling. VPN Tunneling has three components Carrier, Passenger and Encapsulation of data. A thorough explanation of how the data is transmitted and encapsulated over VPN was given. Tunneling can be done site-to-site or through remote access in VPNs. The various advantages of VPN include greater scalability, mobility, security, cost effectiveness, etc. The major disadvantages of VPN are unpredictable internet traffic and understanding of different security issues. A brief presentation was given on the topic of Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) which is used to obtain MAC address from a given IP address. ARP is a stateless protocol which does two jobs that are, responding to a query and ownership announcement. ARP cache tables are maintained to map MAC addresses from IP addresses. The major drawback of ARP is ARP spoofing. ARP announcements are not authenticated, the requests are not tracked and ARP tables can be easily poisoned by man-in-the-middle attack. Various solutions to ARP spoofing involve software-detection solutions such as Xarp, ArpWatch, Anti-arpspoof and MAC binding. The speaker ended the lecture with a amall talk on TCP Session Hijacking, Droppers and BotNets.Session 2: Digital Business TransformationsSpeaker: Mr. Prashant Mehta, SapientMr Prashant Mehta, VP of Sapient, started session mentioning growth of marketing technology landscape over 7 years. We are moving from a mobile first to an AI- first world. It is hard to overstate how big if an impact AI is going to have on society in next 20 years. He mentioned quote by Andrew NG AI is the new electricity. Robots will have an IQ of 10000 in 30 years. The average life span of an S & P company was about 65 years in the 1960s. Now, it’s closer to15 years and it’s projected to get even shorter in the coming years. Four out of ten companies are top ranked companies in their industry won’t survive in the next five years. The pace of change we see today will be a pale shadow of the unfolding future. Future happens very slowly and then all at once. We are at the beginning of the most transformative revolution ever. Whilst many of the technique and algorithm of machine learning and AI have been around since 1950s, only recently we have three factors coincided to provide access to scalable and replicable solutions: cost of compute and storage has fallen; a huge abundance of data and smarter algorithms. He also threw light on five pillars of transformations namely Data and AI, cloud, sensor, ways of working and culture. Talk ended up motivating students to learn and improve their self with time.Session 3: Information Security ThreatsTime: 02.00 PM – 04.00 PMDate: 07/09/2018Cdr L.R Prakash .Head CDAC, Chennai in the session discussed about security auditing , social engineering and proxy servers. He defined security auditing as a systematic evaluation of the security of a company's information system by measuring how well it conforms to a set of established criteria. Further he explained the concept of proxy with the help of a simple example. A proxy server he stated is a dedicated computer or a software system running on a computer that acts as an intermediary between endpoint device . He further stated that proxy helps to speed up the operations. Proxy he explained is used mainly for control, security and convenience .Speaker also briefly stated about squid proxy .Moving the discussion further he explained the concept of social engineering with some real life examples. Social engineering he referred to as psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. He gave example of Royal Bank of Scotland to further explain the concept. Giving the example of Jharkhand gang he explained how using Social engineering ,this gang used aadhar verification calls to target pension accounts .Awareness among the users he suggested as the only way forward to tackle this problem of Social engineering .He further outlined some of famous attacks like petya and wannacry attack . Speaker further presented the concept of Dark Net and its characteristics like it is not searchable, not resolvable and not routable. He listed some of the security firms like Vupen Security, Hacking Team, Cellebrite etc. Talk ended up with encouraging students to go hand in hand with growing technology.PEC welcomed Mr. Bikram Singh Garewal, the university’s oldest alum at Homecoming 2020: Global Alumni Meet.

"https://pec.ac.in/pie/words-hod","Words from HoD | Punjab Engineering College","Quick LinksProduction engineering is a combination of manufacturing technology, engineering sciences with management science. A production engineer typically has a wide knowledge of engineering practices and is aware of the management challenges related to production. The goal is to accomplish the production process in the smoothest, most-judicious and most-economic way. Production engineering encompasses the application of castings, machining processing, joining processes, metal cutting and tool design, metrology, machine tools, machining systems, automation, jigs and fixtures, die and mould design, material science, design of automobile parts, and machine designing and manufacturing. Production engineering also overlaps substantially with manufacturing engineering and industrial engineering.In industry, once the design is realized, production engineering concepts regarding work-study, ergonomics, operation research, manufacturing management, materials management, production planning, etc., play important roles in efficient production processes. These deal with integrated design and efficient planning of the entire manufacturing system, which is becoming increasingly complex with the emergence of sophisticated production methods and control systems.Our Department has the most modern infrastructure to undertake high-end teaching, research and developmental activities in its laboratories, besides highly qualified faculty.

N Sharma, Associate Professor, Department of Applied Sciences, PEC University of Technology has been awarded a project as Co-PI with research grant of Rs 21 Lakh to study snow and glaciers. It is a cluster of multi-institutional national networked project. Dr Sharma happens to be among top researchers who have been selected from prestigious organisations of national repute like IIT- Bombay, Kanpur, Chennai, Kharagpur, IIST-ISRO, DTRL, DRDO, IARI and Central Universities etc it said. It will involve 4 Region-wise central laboratory facilities which will also maintain data acquired. The IIT- Bombay has been identified as national nodal agency to coordinate and maintain data portal of the project through setting up a coordination cell. Total duration of the project is 3 years. The project involves characterization of physical and optical properties of different forms of snow and glaciers using ground truth data collection and remote sensing techniques, he pointed out. The physical process analysis of snow features will provide crucial information to understand and model the snow physical parameters. This will help in creating a data base of such processes from field input and up scaling them on satellite data and thus will help in better understanding of snow and glacier formation. The major beneficiaries of the output of the project will be Army, BRO, DRDO, Deptt of Space Labs, MoEF, MoES, Hydroelectric Energy Producers, Agriculture operators etc. Having second project on glaciers to his credit, Dr Sharma is involved in paleoclimatic studies of glaciers (Hamtah and Siachin) for more than a decade is opined that west Himalayan glaciers are definitely retreating due to global warming. Right from its origin i.e 4600 million years earth had five ice ages. The variations in the Earth’s orbit and shifting plate tectonics spur the waxing and waning of these periods. At present we are living in the interglacial warmer period, hence geologically speaking there is nothing abnormal about global warming. However, anthropogenic forcing from increased greenhouse gases and intensive use of fossil fuels have alarmed the situation to such an extent that human beings own existence is at stake.PEC welcomed Mr. Bikram Singh Garewal, the university’s oldest alum at Homecoming 2020: Global Alumni Meet.
